;Task:
Write a program which uses a timer (with the least granularity available
on your system) to time how long a function takes to execute.

Whenever possible, use methods which measure only the processing time used
by the current process; instead of the difference in [[system time]]
between start and finish, which could include time used by
other processes on the computer.

This task is intended as a subtask for [[Measure relative performance of sorting algorithms implementations]].
