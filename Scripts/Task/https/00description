;Task:
Print an HTTPS URL's content to the console. Checking the host certificate for validity is recommended.

The client should not authenticate itself to the server — the webpage https://sourceforge.net/ supports that access policy — as that is the subject of other [[HTTPS request with authentication|tasks]].

Readers may wish to contrast with the [[HTTP Request]] task, and also the task on [[HTTPS request with authentication]].
