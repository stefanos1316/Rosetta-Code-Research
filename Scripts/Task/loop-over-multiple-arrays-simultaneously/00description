;Task:
Loop over multiple arrays &nbsp; (or lists or tuples or whatever they're called in
your language) &nbsp; and display the &nbsp; <big><big> ''i'' <sup>th</sup> </big></big> &nbsp; element of each.

Use your language's &nbsp; "for each" &nbsp; loop if it has one, otherwise iterate
through the collection in order with some other loop.


For this example, loop over the arrays:
     (a,b,c)
     (A,B,C)
     (1,2,3)
to produce the output:
     aA1
     bB2
     cC3

<br>
If possible, also describe what happens when the arrays are of different lengths.
