[[File:Apollonius.png|400px|Two solutions to the problem of Apollonius|right]]

;Task:
Implement a solution to the Problem of Apollonius &nbsp; ([[wp:Problem_of_Apollonius|description on Wikipedia]]) &nbsp; which is the problem of finding the circle that is tangent to three specified circles. &nbsp; There is an [[wp:Problem_of_Apollonius#Algebraic_solutions|algebraic solution]] which is pretty straightforward.

The solutions to the example in the code are shown in the image (below and right). &nbsp; The red circle is "internally tangent" to all three black circles, and the green circle is "externally tangent" to all three black circles.
