Two or more words are said to be [[Anagrams|anagrams]] if they have the same characters, but in a different order.

By analogy with [[Permutations/Derangements|derangements]] we define a  ''deranged anagram'' as two words with the same characters, but in which the same character does ''not'' appear in the same position in both words.
