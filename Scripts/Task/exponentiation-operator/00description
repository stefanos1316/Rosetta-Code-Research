Most programming languages have a built-in implementation of exponentiation.


;Task:
Re-implement integer exponentiation for both &nbsp; <big>int<sup>int</sup></big> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <big>float<sup>int</sup></big> &nbsp; as both a procedure, &nbsp; and an operator (if your language supports operator definition).

If the language supports operator (or procedure) overloading, then an overloaded form should be provided for both &nbsp; <big>int<sup>int</sup></big> &nbsp; and &nbsp; <big>float<sup>int</sup></big> &nbsp; variants.
