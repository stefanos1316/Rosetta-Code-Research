;Task:
Load the entire contents of some text file as a single string variable.

If applicable, discuss: encoding selection, the possibility of memory-mapping.

Of course, in practice one should avoid reading an entire file at once
if the file is large and the task can be accomplished incrementally instead
(in which case check [[File IO]]);
this is for those cases where having the entire file is actually what is wanted.
