The [[wp:Sieve_of_Eratosthenes|Sieve of Eratosthenes]] is a simple algorithm that finds the prime numbers up to a given integer.


;Task:
Implement the &nbsp; Sieve of Eratosthenes &nbsp; algorithm, with the only allowed optimization that the outer loop can stop at the square root of the limit, and the inner loop may start at the square of the prime just found.

That means especially that you shouldn't optimize by using pre-computed ''wheels'', i.e. don't assume you need only to cross out odd numbers (wheel based on 2), numbers equal to 1 or 5 modulo 6 (wheel based on 2 and 3), or similar wheels based on low primes.

If there's an easy way to add such a wheel based optimization, implement it as an alternative version.


;Note:
* It is important that the sieve algorithm be the actual algorithm used to find prime numbers for the task.
