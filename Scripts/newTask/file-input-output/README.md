# Call an object method

Create a file called   "output.txt",   and place in it the contents of the file   "input.txt",   via an intermediate variable.

In other words, your program will demonstrate:

*  how to read from a file into a variable
*  how to write a variable's contents into a file

Oneliners that skip the intermediate variable are of secondary interest â€” operating systems have copy commands for that.
