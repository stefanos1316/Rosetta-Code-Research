=====================PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE.Socrates, who is the narrator.Glaucon.Adeimantus.Polemarchus.Cephalus.Thrasymachus.Cleitophon.And others who are mute auditors.The scene is laid in the house of Cephalus at the Piraeus; and the whole dialogueis narrated by Socrates the day after it actually took place to Timaeus,Hermocrates, Critias, and a nameless person, who are introduced in the Timaeus.I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that Imight offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian Artemis.); andalso because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival,which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants;but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we hadfinished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of thecity; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sightof us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind,and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.I turned round, and asked him where his master was.There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus appeared,and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, Niceratus the son of Nicias, andseveral others who had been at the procession.Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your companion arealready on your way to the city.You are not far wrong, I said.But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?Of course.And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain whereyou are.May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let us go?But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.Certainly not, replied Glaucon.Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honourof the goddess which will take place in the evening?With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches and passthem one to another during the race?Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated at night,which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after supper and see thisfestival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we will have a good talk.Stay then, and do not be perverse.Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.Very good, I replied.Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found hisbrothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the Chalcedonian,Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus.There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had not seen for along time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushionedchair, and had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the court;and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle, uponwhich we sat down by him. He saluted me eagerly, and then he said:–You don’t come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were still able togo and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But at my age I can hardlyget to the city, and therefore you should come oftener to the Piraeus. For let metell you, that the more the pleasures of the body fade away, the greater to meis the pleasure and charm of conversation. Do not then deny my request, butmake our house your resort and keep company with these young men; we areold friends, and you will be quite at home with us.I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus, than conversingwith aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have gone a journeywhich I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire, whether the way issmooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is a question which I shouldlike to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the ’thresholdof old age’–Is life harder towards the end, or what report do you giveof it?I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my age flocktogether; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says; and at our meetingsthe tale of my acquaintance commonly is –I cannot eat, I cannot drink; the pleasuresof youth and love are fled away: there was a good time once, but nowthat is gone, and life is no longer life. Some complain of the slights which areput upon them by relations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils theirold age is the cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame thatwhich is not really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, andevery other old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not my own experience,nor that of others whom I have known. How well I remember the agedpoet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age,Sophocles,–are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly haveI escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a madand furious master. His words have often occurred to my mind since, and theyseem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them. For certainly oldage has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold,then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only,but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaintsabout relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, butmen’s characters and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature willhardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite dispositionyouth and age are equally a burden.I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go on –Yes,Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in general are not convincedby you when you speak thus; they think that old age sits lightly upon you, notbecause of your happy disposition, but because you are rich, and wealth is wellknown to be a great comforter.You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is something inwhat they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might answer themas Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and saying thathe was famous, not for his own merits but because he was an Athenian: ’If youhad been a native of my country or I of yours, neither of us would have beenfamous.’ And to those who are not rich and are impatient of old age, the samereply may be made; for to the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden,nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself.
