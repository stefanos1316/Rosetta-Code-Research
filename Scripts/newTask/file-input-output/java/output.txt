The Republic By Plato
=====================

PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE.
Socrates, who is the narrator.
Glaucon.
Adeimantus.
Polemarchus.
Cephalus.
Thrasymachus.
Cleitophon.
And others who are mute auditors.
The scene is laid in the house of Cephalus at the Piraeus; and the whole dialogue
is narrated by Socrates the day after it actually took place to Timaeus,
Hermocrates, Critias, and a nameless person, who are introduced in the Timaeus.
I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I
might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian Artemis.); and
also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival,
which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants;
but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had
finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the
city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight
of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant
to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind,
and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.
I turned round, and asked him where his master was.
There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.
Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus appeared,
and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, Niceratus the son of Nicias, and
several others who had been at the procession.
Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your companion are
already on your way to the city.
You are not far wrong, I said.
But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?
Of course.
And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain where
you are.
May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let us go?
But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.
Certainly not, replied Glaucon.
Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.
Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour
of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches and pass
them one to another during the race?
Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated at night,
which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after supper and see this
festival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we will have a good talk.
Stay then, and do not be perverse.
Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.
Very good, I replied.
Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found his
brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the Chalcedonian,
Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus.
There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had not seen for a
long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushioned
chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the court;
and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle, upon
which we sat down by him. He saluted me eagerly, and then he said:–
You don’t come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were still able to
go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But at my age I can hardly
get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener to the Piraeus. For let me
tell you, that the more the pleasures of the body fade away, the greater to me
is the pleasure and charm of conversation. Do not then deny my request, but
make our house your resort and keep company with these young men; we are
old friends, and you will be quite at home with us.
I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus, than conversing
with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have gone a journey
which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire, whether the way is
smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is a question which I should
like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the ’threshold
of old age’–Is life harder towards the end, or what report do you give
of it?
I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my age flock
together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says; and at our meetings
the tale of my acquaintance commonly is –I cannot eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures
of youth and love are fled away: there was a good time once, but now
that is gone, and life is no longer life. Some complain of the slights which are
put upon them by relations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their
old age is the cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that
which is not really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, and
every other old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not my own experience,
nor that of others whom I have known. How well I remember the aged
poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age,
Sophocles,–are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly have
I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad
and furious master. His words have often occurred to my mind since, and they
seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them. For certainly old
age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold,
then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only,
but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaints
about relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, but
men’s characters and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will
hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition
youth and age are equally a burden.
I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go on –Yes,
Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in general are not convinced
by you when you speak thus; they think that old age sits lightly upon you, not
because of your happy disposition, but because you are rich, and wealth is well
known to be a great comforter.
You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is something in
what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might answer them
as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and saying that
he was famous, not for his own merits but because he was an Athenian: ’If you
had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither of us would have been
famous.’ And to those who are not rich and are impatient of old age, the same
reply may be made; for to the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden,
nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself.
