# Exponentiation operation

Explanation is this [link](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Exponentiation_operator)

**Task**

Re-implement integer exponentiation for both   intint   and   floatint   as both a procedure,   and an operator (if your language supports operator definition).

If the language supports operator (or procedure) overloading, then an overloaded form should be provided for both   intint   and   floatint   variants. 

AS test case, we will use the numbers 2017 for int, 19.88 for float, and number 12 as the exponentiation number.
