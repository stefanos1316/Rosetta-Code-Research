# Palindrome detection 

Explanatio in this [link](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Palindrome_detection)

Write a function or program that checks whether a given sequence of characters (or, if you prefer, bytes) is a palindrome.

For extra credit:

* Support Unicode characters.
* Write a second function (possibly as a wrapper to the first) which detects inexact palindromes, i.e. phrases that are palindromes if white-space and punctuation is ignored and case-insensitive comparison is used.

Hints
* It might be useful for this task to know how to reverse a string.
* This task's entries might also form the subjects of the task Test a function.


As a test case, we used the word "saippuakivikauppias" which is considered as the longerst [palindrome word](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-palindromic-word).
