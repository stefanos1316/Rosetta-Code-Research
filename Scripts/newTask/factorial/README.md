# Factorial

**Definitions**

  The   Factorial Function   of a positive integer,   n,   is defined as the product of the sequence:

                 n,   n-1,   n-2,   ...   1 

  The factorial of   0   (zero)   is defined as being   1   (unity).

**Task**

Solutions can be iterative or recursive.

Support for trapping negative   n   errors is optional.
