# Call an object method

Explanatio in this [link](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Call_an_object_method)

In object-oriented programming a method is a function associated with a particular class or object. In most forms of object oriented implementations methods can be static, associated with the class itself; or instance, associated with an instance of a class.

Show how to call a static or class method, and an instance method of a class.

Note: In case of Python, a MemoryError exception appears while using an iteration loop larger than million of times.
The problem relies on so many figures being created and never closed. Somehow python keeps them all alive.
