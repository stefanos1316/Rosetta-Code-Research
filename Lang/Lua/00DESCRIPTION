The name is derived from the Portuguese word for moon.

Lua is commonly described as a "multi-[[:Category:Programming Paradigms|paradigm]]" language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types, rather than providing a more complex and rigid specification to match a single paradigm. 
Lua, for instance, does not contain explicit support for inheritance, but allows it to be implemented relatively easily with metatables. 
Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement namespaces, classes, and other related features using its single table implementation; first class functions allow the employment of many powerful techniques from functional programming; and full lexical scoping allows fine-grained information hiding to enforce the principle of least privilege.

In general, Lua strives to provide flexible meta-features that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. 
As a result, the base language is light—in fact, the full reference interpreter is only about 150KB compiled—and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications.
