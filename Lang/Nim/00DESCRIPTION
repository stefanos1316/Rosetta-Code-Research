{{language programming paradigm|imperative}}
Nim (formerly known as Nimrod) is a general purpose, high-level, system programming, statically typed imperative compiled programming language that is developed by Andreas Rumpf. There is a lot of focus on portability and efficiency. The language compiles to C and supports many C compilers. Nim is actively being developed although it could use more developers. The language has extensive [http://nim-lang.org/docs/lib.html documentation], and a very good [http://nimrod-lang.org/docs/tut1.html tutorial].
