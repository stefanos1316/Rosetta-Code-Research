ObjectIcon is an object oriented variant of [[Icon]] based on an early fork of the [[Unicon]] Project developed by Robert Parlett (one of the co-authors of the Unicon book).
Some of the distinguishing characteristics are:
* a richer set of object oriented keywords 
* support for unicode characters
* replacement of the I/O support with a package
* differences in keywords
