{{implementation|BASIC}}'''PureBasic''' is a "high-level" programming language based on "BASIC" rules. PureBasic has been created for beginners and experts alike. 

PureBasic is a portable programming language with current up to date implementations on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The same code can be compiled and run natively on each OS. An older version for the Amiga platform is no longer maintained.

PureBasic was first released by '''Fantaisie Software''' [http://www.purebasic.com www.purebasic.com] in 2001. Since then the language is being improved and expanded continuously.
