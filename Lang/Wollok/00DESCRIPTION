{{language}}

Wollok is a programming language and environment for teaching OOP.
It is currently under active development.

It takes away syntax complexity and focus on objects, messages and polymorphism.

It features objects as first class citizens in order to start programming OOP without the need of classes (and its complexity).
But it also supports classes and simple inheritance.
