LiveCode (formerly known as Revolution) is a byte-code compiled language created by [http://www.runrev.com Runtime Revolution]

It is inspired by HyperCard/HyperTalk, but goes far beyond that heritage by:
*Creating applications that run on:
** OS X
** Mac Classic
** Windows
** Unix
** iOS
** Android
** Web Servers (with LiveCode sever)
** Web Browser HTML5 Engine (as of version 8)
*Having a full interface toolkit with native widgets on all platforms
*Incorporating modern language features like regex, associative arrays, support for internet protocols, etc.
*Supporting color natively (HyperCard die-hards are now breathing a sigh of relief)
** As of version 8 LiveCode includes an additional, strictly typed language variant called LiveCodeBuilder (LCB) which allows access to foreign code libraries (currently supports C libraries only, support for others to be added)
