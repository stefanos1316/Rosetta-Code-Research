Liberty BASIC is a procedural programming language for [[Windows]] PCs, created by Shoptalk Systems. It was intended as a simple way to create professional programs, with full [[GUI]] ability, while still keeping a very simple [[BASIC]] syntax.  While the current version only supports Windows, the next major release will support [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]] as well. Liberty BASIC runs under Wine on Linux at present.
