'''Common Lisp''', commonly abbreviated '''CL''', is a dialect of the [[derived from::Lisp]] programming language, standardised by [[ANSI]] X3.226-1994. Developed as a common successor to Maclisp and Lisp Machine Lisp, it is not an implementation but a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including commercial products and [[open source]] software.

Common Lisp is a general-purpose programming language, in contrast to Lisp variants such as [[Emacs Lisp]] and AutoLISP which are embedded extension languages in particular products. Unlike many earlier Lisps, Common Lisp (like [[derived from::Scheme]]) uses lexical variable scope.

The "CL-USER> " prompt seen in front of some examples shows that the code was run in a Lisp [[read-eval-print loop]], or REPL, running interactively in an environment such as [[SLIME]].
