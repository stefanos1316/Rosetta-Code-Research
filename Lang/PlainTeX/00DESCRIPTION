{{language|plainTeX}}
plainTeX is the name used to refer to the default set of ''macros'' which are always present on all [[TeX]] systems
(and it is the default preloaded format for <tt>tex</tt> executable). They were written by Knuth himself, and provide the basic to start using [[TeX]] (since "raw" [[TeX]] is not ready-to-use for documents creation). Often when one says simply "TeX document", s/he means s/he is using the plainTeX macros, even though nowadays the success of the complex feature-full [[LaTeX]] macros package creates a little bit of confusion and a lot of people, ignoring that LaTeX is just one of possible macro packages for TeX, think that LaTeX is TeX and viceversa.

Extension to the plainTeX exists, like eplain(TeX).

Even though [[LaTeX]] is nowadays almost a typesetting "standard" when using a [[TeX]] system, plainTeX is still usable and used.
