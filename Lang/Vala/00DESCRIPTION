'''Vala''' is a programming language created with the goal of bringing modern language features to [[C]], with no added runtime requirements and with little overhead, by targeting the GObject object system. It is being developed by JÃ¼rg Billeter and Raffaele Sandrini. The syntax borrows heavily from [[C#]]. Rather than being compiled directly to assembler or to another intermediate language, Vala is compiled to C which is then compiled with a platform's standard C compiler.
