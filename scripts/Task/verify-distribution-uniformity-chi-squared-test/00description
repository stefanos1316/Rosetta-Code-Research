In this task, write a function to verify that a given distribution of values is uniform by using the [[wp:Pearson's chi-square test|<math>\chi^2</math> test]] to see if the distribution has a likelihood of happening of at least the significance level (conventionally 5%). The function should return a boolean that is true if the distribution is one that a uniform distribution (with appropriate number of degrees of freedom) may be expected to produce.
