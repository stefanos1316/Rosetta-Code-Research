A [[wp:Vampire_number|vampire number]] is a natural number with an even number of digits, that can be factored into two integers. These two factors are called the ''fangs'', and must have the following properties:
* they each contain half the number of the digits of the original number
* together they consist of exactly the same digits as the original number
* at most one of them has a trailing zero

An example of a Vampire number and its fangs: <code> 1260 : (21, 60) </code>


;Task:
# Print the first 25 Vampire numbers and their fangs.
# Check if the following numbers are Vampire numbers and, if  so, print them and their fangs:
<big><code> 16758243290880,  24959017348650,  14593825548650 </code></big>

<br>
Note that a Vampire number can have more than one pair of fangs.
