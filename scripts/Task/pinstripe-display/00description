The task is to demonstrate the creation of a series of 1 pixel wide vertical pinstripes across the entire width of the display. The pinstripes should alternate one pixel white, one pixel black.

Quarter of the way down the display, we can switch to a wider 2 pixel wide vertical pinstripe pattern, alternating two pixels white, two pixels black. Half way down the display, we switch to 3 pixels wide, and for the lower quarter of the display we use 4 pixels.
