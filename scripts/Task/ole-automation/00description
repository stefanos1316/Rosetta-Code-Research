[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLE_Automation OLE Automation] is an inter-process communication mechanism based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model Component Object Model] (COM) on Microsoft Windows.

Provide an automation server implementing objects that can be accessed by a client running in a separate process.  The client gets a proxy-object that can call methods on the object.
The communication should be able to handle conversions of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_type variants] to and from the native value types.
