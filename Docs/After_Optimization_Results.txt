After applying Compiler Optimizations 
=====================================

C-Sharp
=======
increased energy for sorting algorithms quick, insertion, bubble, decode from 1-10%
reduce energy for merge, selection, classes, url-encode and decode from 3,8-36,3%

C
=
reduced energy usage for all sorting algorithms from 43,36--99,6%
reduced energy usage for encoding 25,2%
increased energy usage for decoding 14,7%

C++
===
saved energy for sorting and classes from 0,9--85,71%
saved energy for encoding 31,76%
increased energy for decoding 33,33%

Go
==
reduced energy for sorting 14,39--21,4% apart from insertion which increase 15,38%
savings for decoding 31,35%
increased for encoding 62%

Java
====
saved energy for all tasks ranging from 6--98,4%

Rust
====
saved energy for all tasks ranging from 15,8--97,9% apart from classes, increased to 15,4%
