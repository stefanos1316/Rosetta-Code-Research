[[wp:GOST (block cipher)|GOST 28147-89]] is a standard symmetric encryption based on a [[wp:Feistel cipher|Feistel network]]. Structure of the algorithm consists of three levels:

# encryption modes - simple replacement, application range, imposing a range of feedback and authentication code generation;
# cycles - 32-З, 32-Р and 16-З, is a repetition of the main step;
# ''main step'', a function that takes a 64-bit block of text and one of the eight 32-bit encryption key elements, and uses the replacement table (8x16 matrix of 4-bit values), and returns encrypted block.

Implement the main step of this encryption algorithm.
