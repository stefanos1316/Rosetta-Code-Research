Show that the following remarkable formula gives the [http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A000037 sequence] of non-square [[wp:Natural_number|natural numbers]]:
  n + floor(1/2 + sqrt(n))
* Print out the values for &nbsp; <big> n </big> &nbsp; in the range &nbsp; '''1''' &nbsp; to &nbsp; '''22'''
* Show that no squares occur for &nbsp; <big> n </big> &nbsp; less than one million


This sequence is also known as &nbsp; [http://oeis.org/A000037 A000037] &nbsp; in the '''OEIS''' database.
