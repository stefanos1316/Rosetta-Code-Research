;Task:
Calculate the dates of:
:::* &nbsp; [[wp:Easter|Easter]]
:::* &nbsp; [[wp:Ascension Thursday|Ascension Thursday]]
:::* &nbsp; [[wp:Pentecost|Pentecost]]
:::* &nbsp; [[wp:Trinity Sunday|Trinity Sunday]]
:::* &nbsp; [[wp:Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi feast]]


As an example, calculate for the first year of each century from;
:::* &nbsp; years &nbsp; &nbsp; 400 &nbsp; to &nbsp; 2100 [[wp:Common Era|CE]] &nbsp; and for
:::* &nbsp; years &nbsp;       2010 &nbsp; to &nbsp; 2020 CE.


;Note:
From year 325 CE on, &nbsp; [[wp:Easter Sunday|Easter Sunday]] &nbsp; is the Sunday following the ﬁrst &nbsp; [[wp:Ecclesiastical full moon|Ecclesiastical full moon]] &nbsp; not earlier than the equinox date in 325 — 21 March. &nbsp; The Ecclesiastical full moon does not always correspond to the astronomical full moon since in &nbsp; year 325 &nbsp; ﬁne details of Lunar dynamics were not yet fully understood.

[[wp:Metonic cycle|Metonic cycle]]: &nbsp; Taking a year to be 1/19th of this 6940-day cycle gives a year length of 365&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/76 days (the unrounded cycle is much more accurate), &nbsp; which is slightly more than 12 synodic months. &nbsp; To keep the 12-month lunar year in pace with the solar year, &nbsp; an &nbsp;  [[wp:intercalary|intercalary]] &nbsp; 13th month would have to be added on seven occasions during the nineteen-year period.  &nbsp; Meton introduced a formula for intercalation in circa &nbsp; 432&nbsp;BC.
