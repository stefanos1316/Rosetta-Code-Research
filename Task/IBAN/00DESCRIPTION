The [[wp:International_Bank_Account_Number|International Bank Account Number (IBAN)]] is an internationally agreed means of identifying bank accounts across national borders with a reduced risk of propagating [[wp:Transcription_error|transcription errors]]. <br>
The IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters: first the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code, then two check digits, and finally a country-specific Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN). <br>
The check digits enable a sanity check of the bank account number to confirm its integrity even before submitting a transaction.

The task here is to validate the following fictitious IBAN: <tt>GB82 WEST 1234 5698 7654 32</tt>.

Details of the algorithm can be found on the Wikipedia page.
