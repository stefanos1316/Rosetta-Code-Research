;The game:
Given an N by N square array of zeroes or ones in an initial
configuration, and a target configuration of zeroes and ones
The task is to transform one to the other in as few moves as
possible by inverting whole numbered rows or whole lettered
columns at once, as one move.

In an inversion any 1 becomes 0, and any 0 becomes 1 for that
whole row or column.

;Task:
Create a program to score for the Flipping bits game.
# The game should create an original random target configuration and a starting configuration.
# Ensure that the starting position is ''never'' the target position.
# The target position must be guaranteed as reachable from the starting position. (One possible way to do this is to generate the start position by legal flips from a random target position. The flips will always be reversible back to the target from the given start position).
# The number of moves taken so far should be shown.
