If the program uses UTF-8 or UTF-16, it must work on any valid Unicode code point,
whether in the Basic Multilingual Plane or above it.

The program must reference logical characters (code points), not 8-bit code units for UTF-8 or 16-bit code units for UTF-16.

Programs for other encodings (such as 8-bit ASCII, or EUC-JP) are not required to handle all Unicode characters.
